# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores the COVID-19 pandemic using the "Our World in Data" dataset. It focuses on trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress in Kenya, the United States, and India.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across three countries.
- Visualize trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare the vaccination rollout and identify key patterns.
- Generate insights from the data to understand the global response.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Download the repository or notebook file: `COVID19_EDA_Report.ipynb`.
2. Ensure you have Python installed with the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook COVID19_EDA_Report.ipynb
   ```
4. Download the OWID dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) and place it in the same folder as the notebook.
5. Execute each cell in the notebook to view visualizations and insights.

ðŸ“Š Insights & Reporting
1. United States Led in Early Vaccination Rollout
The United States showed a rapid increase in cumulative vaccinations starting in late 2020 and early 2021. By mid-2021, over 50% of the U.S. population had been fully vaccinated, far ahead of Kenya and India during the same period.

2. India Experienced Sharp Surges in New Cases
India exhibited two prominent spikes in daily new COVID-19 cases â€” one in mid-2021 and another in early 2022 â€” likely corresponding to the Delta and Omicron variant outbreaks. These surges far exceeded case numbers in both Kenya and the United States during the same windows.

3. Kenya Lagged Behind in Vaccination Coverage
Despite steady growth, Kenya had significantly lower vaccination coverage throughout the observed period. By the latest available date, only around 20-30% of the population had been fully vaccinated.

4. Death Rate Was Higher in Early Stages
All countries showed a relatively higher death rate during the early stages of the pandemic when testing and treatments were limited. Over time, the death rate stabilized or declined as vaccination and treatment strategies improved.

5. Vaccination Progress Correlates with Case Reduction
In all countries, increases in the percentage of the vaccinated population were followed by periods of case stabilization or decline â€” suggesting the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in controlling the spread.
